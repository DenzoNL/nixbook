# Nixbook

My personal flake for a MacOS workstation using `nix-darwin` and `home-manager`

## TODO

- [ ] Manage secrets through `sops-nix` and/or `age`
  - [ ] SSH key
  - [ ] GPG key
- [ ] IntelliJ IDEs (and their configs)
- [ ] More thorough VS Code configuration
- [ ] Less janky oh-my-zsh setup
- [ ] Move any apps to `home-manager`, declarative `homebrew` or `mas`
- [ ] Find out what custom macOS settings I use and set them declaratively
